## [Tasks and achievements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1woy6g1GAk62cseEBax0T3lwjwMm98c7SzoWzxnyRNGk/edit?usp=sharing)
## Content of the project
- Find a public data (e.g. data on Kaggle) about a subject your group is interested in
- Explore data (often interleaved with preprocessing data)
- Identify meaningful questions which can be answered with this data
- Preprocess and analyze data to answer each question
## Implementation process
`After the group meeting, the group assigned the following implementation sequence:`
- Nguyễn Dương Trường Sinh: collecting and preprocessing the data.
- Nguyễn Tấn Phát: exploring the data and preprocessing data to answer questions.
- Nguyễn Trọng Phúc: asking meaningful questions and answer questions.
## Environment
> We mainly use Python Jupyter Notebook in this assignment for exploring and preprocessing data to answer meaningful question that can be answered with data.
